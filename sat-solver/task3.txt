No, the Expression interface cannot be a FunctionalInterface.
Justification:

A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. 
It can have default or static methods, but can have only one abstract method is allowed.
In Expression, it has two abstract methods, which are 'evaluate()' and 'variables()'
